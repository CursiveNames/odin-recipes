            that will melt right in your mouth, and that can be easily made with your family<br>
            and friends.

            to make, and the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient<br> 
            list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
        </p>

        <h3> The Ingredients </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Whisk egg yolks, 4 tablespoons white sugar, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl<br> 
                until thick and creamy; set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour cream into a saucepan and stir over low heat until it almost comes to a boil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Whisk cream into egg yolk mixture; beat until combined.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour mixture into the top pan of a double boiler. Stir over simmering water until<br> 
                mixture lightly coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour into a shallow heat-proof dish.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until custard is set, about 30 minutes. Let cool to room<br> 
                temperature, then refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour or overnight.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Place dish under the broiler until sugar melts and caramelizes, about 2 minutes.<br> 
                Watch carefully so as not to burn.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Allow to cool slightly, then refrigerate until custard is set again, about 10<br> 
                minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Enjoy your creation</li>

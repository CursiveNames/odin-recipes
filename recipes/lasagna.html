        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat<br> 
                until well browned.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with<br> 
                sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel<br> 
                seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in<br> 
                boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons<br> 
                parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <br>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking<br> 
                dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta<br> 
                cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups<br>
                meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with<br> 
                foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the<br> 
                foil does not touch the cheese.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an<br> 
                additional 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>

# odin-recipes

I am going to write a web-page with recipes for different foods, as a method of demonstrating previously earned HTML5 skills on TOP.
The skills that will be demonstrated, as of my writing, will most likely be:
    - Git implementation
    - CLI Interface work
    - Understanding of basic HTML principles
    - Work with HTML elements
    - Implementation of multiple-page recipes
    - Troubleshooting
    - Neat working enviornment processes
